    desc1="High pressure jetting is a process that involves using high pressure water jets to clean and clear blocked or clogged pipes. It is often used to remove debris, such as grease, oil, sediment, and tree roots, that can build up in pipes and cause them to become blocked."
    desc2="High pressure jetting is a highly effective method for clearing blocked pipes because the high pressure water jets are able to break up and remove even the most stubborn blockages. It is also a safe and environmentally friendly option, as it does not require the use of harsh chemicals or other potentially harmful substances."
    desc3="To perform high pressure jetting, a specialized machine is used to generate the high pressure water jets. The machine is connected to a hose that is inserted into the blocked pipe. The high pressure water jets are then directed through the hose and into the pipe, where they break up and remove the blockage."
    desc4="High pressure jetting is a useful tool for a wide range of applications, including cleaning and maintaining sewer lines, drain lines, and other types of pipes. If you have a blocked pipe, it is a good idea to consider using high pressure jetting to clear it, as it can be a quick and effective solution."
